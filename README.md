# Linux-Enhancement-Scripts
Are you constantly stressed by your Linux system? You are constantly in dispute?
Then I have something for you, the Linux-Enhancement-Scripts for a better, trustworthy cooperation
between humans and machines. These scripts should simplify your life and give you more control over your operating system.
Most scripts can be directly executed under Linux without any installation of further software.

**Hint:** The scripts were written with GNU bash (`version 4.4.20(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`) and Python 3.6.9
or above. They were designed for Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa and above. I cannot guarantee that they will work on other systems 
than Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia.

## Dated Folder Creator
Creates a number of folders with the current date and a count with padding in the format `yyyy-MM-dd-[count]`
e.g. `2018-10-14-01, 2018-10-14-02, ..., 2018-10-14-12`.

## Files Lister
Lists all files from current directory with different settings.

## Inkscape PNG Exporter
Exports for all Inkscape `*.svg`-files in a folder and its subfolders corresponding `*.png`-files 
to an existent destination-folder. The script was tested with Inkscape 0.92.3 (2405546, 2018-03-11).

## PNG-Flipper
Allows to flip pictures from a given path by using commands `FlipX`, `FlipY`. 
It is also possible to give the flipped pictures a name extension like `_up`, `_down`.

## Processes Lister
Lists the names from active processes.

## Services Lister
Lists the names from services.
