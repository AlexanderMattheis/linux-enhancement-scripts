# Linux-Enhancement-Scripts
Are you constantly stressed by your Linux system? You are constantly in dispute?
Then I have something for you, the Linux-Enhancement-Scripts for a better, trustworthy cooperation
between humans and machines. That scripts should simplify your life and give you more control over your operating system.
Most scripts can be directly executed under Linux without any installation of further software.

**Hint:** The scripts were written with GNU bash, `version 4.4.20(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)` and designed for Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa.
So, I cannot guarantee that they will work on other systems than Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa.
